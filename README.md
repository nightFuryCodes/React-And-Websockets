# React-and-Websockets
A simple, real-time chat app built with ⚛️ React (frontend) and 🟧 Express (backend), using 🔌 WebSockets for instant, bidirectional messaging between users. The project is organized for scalability, with Frontend and Backend folders. 🚀 To get started, clone the repo, install dependencies in both folders (npm install), and launch servers (npm run start for backend, npm run dev for frontend). 🌟 Future enhancements could include user authentication, group chats, and typing indicators. Contributions are welcome! 👥

The frontend is currently being hosted on vercel at https://react-and-websockets-gamma.vercel.app and the backend on render. You can open multiple tabs or windows and see that the chatbox is functioning correctly and in real-time. Just wait for a few seconds for the express server to get started.
