# React-and-Websockets
A simple, real-time chat app built with ⚛️ React (frontend) and 🟧 Express (backend), using 🔌 WebSockets for instant, bidirectional messaging between users. The project is organized for scalability, with Frontend and Backend fodlers. 🚀 To get started, clone the repo, install dependencies in both folders (npm install), and launch servers (npm run start for backend, npm run dev for frontend). Access your app locally at http://localhost:3000. 🌟 Future enhancements could include user authentication, group chats, and typing indicators. Contributions are welcome! 👥
